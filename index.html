        <p>
            I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
            Department of   Aerospace engineering</a> at the
            <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I am advised by 
            <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/jeannin-jean-baptiste/">Prof. Jean-Baptiste Jeannin</a>. 
            I completed my masters in <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
            Aerospace engineering</a> at the <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> in 2020. 
            I received a bachelors degree in <a href= "https://iitk.ac.in/aero/">
            Aerospace engineering </a>
            from the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Insitute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur</a>, India in 2018. 
            My research interests are formal methods, programming languages, numerical analysis and control theory. I am interested in analyzing the accuracy 
            and convergence properties of numerical schemes. I work with interactive theorem provers like Coq Proof
            assistant, HOL4, to formalize numerical approximation errors and bound them formally. I am also interested in
            automated reasoning using SMT/SAT solvers and use light weight code analysis tools like Frama-C/VST 
            to certify results obtained from numerical programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my PhD, my research activity has mostly been aligned in the direction of applying
            formal methods to problems in numerical analysis and control theory. I have been working
            at the intersection of formal methods and Computational mechanics (my undergraduate coursework
            and research has primarily been in this field).
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides research I enjoy outdoor activities like Kayaking, hiking etc. I like to workout and spend
            time with nature. I also like to go on road trips and enjoy rock music. I like to 
            collect vinyl records. I am a huge fan of the AC/DC, Beatles and Deep Purple. 
        </p>

            a theorem in the Coq proof assistant, that provides sufficient and necessary conditions for
            a distributed control systems to reach consensus. We specifically look at a case where there 
            are atmost F malicious nodes in the system that can disrupt information flow between uncorrupted 
            nodes in the network.
